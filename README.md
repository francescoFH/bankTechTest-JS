#Bank Tech Tests - JavaScript

Example of tech test to practice code quality and process.

This is a reimplementation of my Ruby tech test, [available here](https://github.com/francescoFH/bank-tech-test).

It allows you to create an account, deposit funds into it, withdraw funds from it, and print statements.
